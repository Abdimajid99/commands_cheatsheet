# This must be the first line in a script as tells the shell what interpretor to use for the script.
# The env tool checks where the correct location of bash is in the system.

# set -euo pipefail

# set -e  -- Exit on error
# set -u  -- Exit on unset variable
# set -o pipefail -- Exit on pipe fail

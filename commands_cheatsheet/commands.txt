shell (e.g bash, zsh, fish ):
-- is a program that lets you interface with the linux kernel.
-- it is what does the work when you type a command in the terminal.

Terminal ( also called command line and console ):
-- is a program that lets you interface with the shell

$PATH 
-- it's an environment variable that's set in your shell that lets it know exactly which directories to search in whenever it's looking for a command.

to add a script directory to the path run:
export PATH=$PATH:(the directory path)
this only adds it for the current shell session so make sure to add it to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if you want it to persist.
